# Sandwich_Club

# Project Overview

# Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.


# What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:
1. 	Learn how to submit projects for review
2. 	Practice JSON parsing to a model object
3. 	Design an activity layout
4. 	Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
